              <p>
                Kampus Agency was founded by a Computer Engineering student
                inspired by the 'lone wolf' philosophy, rejecting conventional
                team advice to prove that individual effort can achieve great
                success. Since 2022, we've grown from internal projects to
                landing our first paying client in 2024. Today, we drive digital
                innovation through expert design, development, and marketing,
                building strong global partnerships.{" "}
